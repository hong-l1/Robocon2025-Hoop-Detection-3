The dataset includes 4495 images.
Basketball-objects-KBDi are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -5 and +5 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 0.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.81 percent of pixels
